### Rod-cutting Problem

* Given a 10-meter rod, where a 3-meter rod can be sold for $ 1.80, and a 4-meter rod can be sold for $ 2.00 dollars, what is the optimum way of cutting this rod to maximise the revenue?
    * Initial decision is to cut a 3-meter vs 4-meter rod
    * After committing the initial decision, the next problem is to optimise
